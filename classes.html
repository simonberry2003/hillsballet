        <div class="textboxtop2">Little Tiptoes (18 months - 3 years)</div>
        <div class="textbox">
Little Tiptoes is a fun, creative class to introduce your little dancer to the world of dance. Using classical ballet scores, action songs, nursery rhymes and a broad range of other musical styles we explore a termly theme.<p>This class is specifically designed to meet the needs of a toddler. We encourage carers to take an active role and support dancers as they learn how to explore dance in a group environment. We love to see our little dancers express themselves through their dance.

        <div class="textboxtop2">Pre-Primary /Primary Ballet (5 years - 7 years)</div>
        <div class="textbox">
These classes are for our school aged dancers who are ready for a little more structure. We follow the Royal Academy of Dance syllabus which encourages a great deal of creativity whilst still developing a basic classical ballet technique.<p>Children at this age have the opportunity to begin to take Ballet Examinations if they choose to.

        <div class="textboxtop2">Grade 1/Grade 2 Ballet (7 years - 9 years)</div>
        <div class="textbox">
By this level our ballerinas and danseurs have a good understanding of ballet basics. They are starting to dance with more understanding about posture and dance sequencing and are developing an ability to talk about ballet and dance using the correct terminology.<p>We explore open classes (unset exercises) as well as working towards the Royal Academy of Dance Grade Examinations.<p>There is no requirement for students to sit their exams however we encourage all of our students to work to their best. Most importantly we encourage them to have fun and enjoy the challenges!
