						<p>Little Tiptoes is the perfect class to introduce your
						littlest dancer to the world of ballet and movement. Using
						classical ballet music, action songs, nursery rhymes and many
						other musical styles, we explore a different theme each term.</p>
						<p>This class is specifically designed to meet the needs of
						toddlers. At Hills Ballet School we understand the world of our
						littlest dancers and love to see them embrace dance and movement.</p>
						<p>We encourage carers to take an active role and support dancers as
						they learn how to explore dance in a group environment. We have
						lots of tips to help our Little Tiptoe's ballerinas and danseurs
						settle in to their new environment and make it an exciting place
						to explore the creative arts.</p>

						Each term ends with a sharing of dance so we can share all the wonderful new skills we have learned.</p>

						maintain the fun and energy of our younger classes and use a range

						<p>By this level our ballerinas and danseurs have a good
							understanding of ballet basics. They are starting to dance with
							more understanding about posture and dance sequencing and are
							developing an ability to talk about ballet and dance using the
							correct terminology.</p>
						<p>We explore open classes (unset exercises) as well as
							working towards the Royal Academy of Dance Grade Examinations.</p>
						<p>There is no requirement for students to sit their exams
							however we encourage all of our students to work to their best.
							Most importantly we encourage them to have fun and enjoy the
							challenges!</p>

						<p>Hills Ballet School is very excited to be introducing our Musical Theatre classes in 2017. 
						Aimed at children from approximately 8 years of age, these classes will explore songs from popular 
						musicals whilst developing singing, stage craft, dance and performance skills. 
						Performers will be taught by a singing teacher and a dance teacher to help develop strong techniques. 
						We hope to share our work at the end of each term in an informal setting with friends and family.</p>
