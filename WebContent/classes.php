					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>Little Tiptoes is the perfect class to introduce your
							littlest dancer to the world of ballet and movement. Using
							classical ballet music, action songs, nursery rhymes and many
							other musical styles, we explore a different theme each term.</p>
						<p>This class is specifically designed to meet the needs of
							toddlers. At Hills Ballet School we understand the world of our
							littlest dancers and love to see them embrace dance and movement.
							We encourage carers to take an active role and support dancers as
							they learn how to explore dance in a group environment. We have
							lots of tips to help our Little Tiptoes ballerinas and danseurs
							settle in to their new environment and make it an exciting place
							to explore the creative arts.</p>

						<h3 class="panel-title">Leap into Dance (3 years - 5 years)</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">When your dancer is ready to dance
						independently he/she is ready to "Leap into Dance". In this class
						we begin to introduce more fundamental ballet concepts but still
						explore dance in a fun creative way. Each term we explore a theme
						and at the end of each term we share our dancing with parents and
						carers.</div>
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title">Pre-Primary /Primary Ballet (5 years
							- 7 years)</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">When dancers reach school age they
						are ready for a little more structure in their ballet class. We
						draw upon the Royal Academy of Dance syllabus for our lessons,
						which encourages a great deal of creativity while still developing
						the foundations of a classical ballet technique. We make sure we
						maintain the fun and energy of our younger classes and use a range
						of music to inspire young dancers. Children at this age have the
						opportunity to begin to take Ballet Examinations should they
						choose to.</div>
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title">Grade 1/Grade 2 Ballet (7 years - 9
							years)</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>By this level our ballerinas and danseurs have a good
							understanding of ballet basics. They are starting to dance with
							more understanding about posture and dance sequencing and are
							developing an ability to talk about ballet and dance using the
							correct terminology.</p>
						<p>We explore open classes (unset exercises) as well as
							working towards the Royal Academy of Dance Grade Examinations.</p>
						<p>There is no requirement for students to sit their exams
							however we encourage all of our students to work to their best.
							Most importantly we encourage them to have fun and enjoy the
							challenges!</p>

						<h3 class="panel-title">Locomotion</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">Specifically designed for boys who
						love to move and groove, this class is fast moving and full of
						fun! Locomotion has been created to give your little boy the dance
						foundation he needs, developing coordination, body awareness,
						rhythm and a joy of movement.</div>
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title">Tap</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">Our Tap classes are new this year.
						Lots of fun and a little bit noisy, we love the rhythms of our tap
						classes. Dancers are able to hire tap shoes from us when available
						and need to be attending a ballet class to take part.</div>
