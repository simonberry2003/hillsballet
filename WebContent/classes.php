        <div class="textboxtop2">Little Tiptoes (18 months - 3 years)</div>
        <div class="textbox">
            Little Tiptoes is the perfect class to introduce your littlest dancer to the world of ballet and movement. 
            Using classical ballet music, action songs, nursery rhymes and many other musical styles, we explore a different 
            theme each term.
            <p>This class is specifically designed to meet the needs of toddlers. At Hills Ballet School we understand the 
            world of our littlest dancers and love to see them embrace dance and movement. We encourage carers to take an 
            active role and support dancers as they learn how to explore dance in a group environment. We have lots of tips 
            to help our Little Tiptoes ballerinas and danseurs settle in to their new environment and make it an exciting 
            place to explore the creative arts.

        <div class="textboxtop2">Leap into Dance (3 years - 5 years)</div>
        <div class="textbox">
            When your dancer is ready to dance independently he/she is ready to "Leap into Dance". 
            In this class we begin to introduce more fundamental ballet concepts but still explore dance in a fun creative way. 
            Each term we explore a theme and at the end of each term we share our dancing with parents and carers.

        <div class="textboxtop2">Pre-Primary /Primary Ballet (5 years - 7 years)</div>
        <div class="textbox">
            When dancers reach school age they are ready for a little more structure in their ballet class. 
            We draw upon the Royal Academy of Dance syllabus for our lessons, which encourages a great deal of 
            creativity while still developing the foundations of a classical ballet technique. 
            We make sure we maintain the fun and energy of our younger classes and use a range of music to 
            inspire young dancers. Children at this age have the opportunity to begin to take Ballet 
            Examinations should they choose to.

        <div class="textbox">
By this level our ballerinas and danseurs have a good understanding of ballet basics. They are starting to dance with more understanding about posture and dance sequencing and are developing an ability to talk about ballet and dance using the correct terminology.<p>We explore open classes (unset exercises) as well as working towards the Royal Academy of Dance Grade Examinations.<p>There is no requirement for students to sit their exams however we encourage all of our students to work to their best. Most importantly we encourage them to have fun and enjoy the challenges!
