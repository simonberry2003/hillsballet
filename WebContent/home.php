	        Welcome to Hills Ballet School located in the beautiful Adelaide Hills. We are a South Australian family owned ballet school sharing the love of dance with children.
	        <p>The "Little Tiptoes" programme is specifically designed to meet the needs of younger dancers. Your little dancer can tiptoe with your support from the age of eighteen months.
	        <p>When dancers are ready to dance independently they can join the "Leap into Dance" programme. In this fun, dynamic class, dancers are introduced to the basics of ballet 
	        technique, encouraging their creativity and love of movement.
	        <p>Once dancers reach school age our lessons are based upon the Royal Academy of Dancing syllabus. At this level dancers can choose to participate in examinations. 
	        Above all we maintain our sense of fun and enjoyment that the challenges of dancing can bring.
	        <p>We would love you to join us at Hills Ballet School and are currently taking enrolments for 2015. If you would like to come along for a trial lesson or to 
	        find our more information, please feel free to <a href="mailto:info@hillsballetschool.com.au?Subject=Info" target="_top">contact us</a>.
