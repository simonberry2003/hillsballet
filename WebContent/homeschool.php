<p>We are delighted to be able to offer a bespoke Home-school Performing Arts service to families or groups of families.
<p>HBS will work with parents and children to create a project or unit of work designed to engage and encourage the creative performing arts. Projects will take into account the  objectives targeted in Australian Curriculum framework.
<p>We are open to suggestions regarding projects which might range from small performances/displays to dance/drama lessons exploring a range of genres  to performing arts workshops. 
<p>The possibilities are endless, so let us help your child/children explore their artistic potential!
<p>Payment: Costs will be calculated for each bespoke project individually. Fees will cover the cost of hall hire, teacher costs, insurance/copyright fees, a small admin fee and any extra expenses.
A contract between the Home-school family will be drawn up.  Payment should be made before the project commences.
