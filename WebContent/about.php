						<p>Hills Ballet school is a family owned ballet school located
							in the Adelaide Hills. We currently hold ballet classes at the
							Mount Lofty Scout Hut in Aldgate and the Aldgate Oval Hall.</p>
						<p>Our aim is to provide high quality, dynamic ballet and
							dance lessons that celebrate each dancer as an individual.</p>
						<p>The "Little Tiptoes" programme is specifically designed to
							meet the needs of younger dancers. Your little dancer can tiptoe
							with your support from the age of eighteen months.</p>
						<p>When dancers are ready to dance independently they can join
							the "Leap into Dance" programme. In this fun, dynamic class,
							dancers are introduced to the basics of ballet technique,
							encouraging their creativity and love of movement.</p>
						<p>Once dancers reach school age our lessons are based upon
							the Royal Academy of Dancing syllabus. At this level dancers can
							choose to participate in examinations. Above all we maintain our
							sense of fun and enjoyment that the challenges of dancing can
							bring.</p>
						<p>Hills Ballet School classes are taught by Chantal Berry
							(RTS (Registered Teacher Status), BA (Performing Arts), PGCE
							(Post Grad Certificate of Education).</p>

						<h3 class="panel-title">A Little About Chantal</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>I have danced and taught in Australia, UK and Europe
							working as an independent artist. I have extensive teaching
							experience in ballet and am a registered teacher for the Royal
							Academy of Dancing.</p>
						<p>Whilst taking a break from the world of dance I trained as
							a primary school teacher and now bring to my classes a love of
							dance and an in-depth knowledge of child development.</p>
						<p>As well as twirling with my dancers at Hills Ballet School
							this year I will be ballet mistress at A Star dance and help some
							of Bebe Ballet’s dancers through their exams.</p>
						<p>I am very thankful to all the little dancers who have
							re-ignited my love of dance, ballet and the joy of movement over
							the last 2 years. I can’t wait to share this with my dancers and
							their families as we embark on an exciting journey into dance at
							Hills Ballet School.</p>
