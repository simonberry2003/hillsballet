						<p>Hills Ballet school is a family owned ballet school located in the Adelaide Hills. 
						We currently hold ballet classes at the Mount Lofty Scout Hut in Aldgate and the Aldgate Oval Hall.</p>
						<p>Our aim is to provide high quality, dynamic ballet and dance lessons that celebrate each 
						dancer as an individual. We love to see our dancers' personalities shine through as they develop 
						a movement vocabulary and style.</p>
						<p>Offering a range of classes to children from the age of eighteen months old we provide an excellent 
						movement foundation for children as they get ready for kindy and school.</p>
						<p>Following the Royal Academy of Dance syllabus from Pre-Primary onwards our little dancers receive 
						an exciting introduction to dance, full of imagination and creativity.  As they get a little older 
						we invite them to extend their movement range with our tap, contemporary and musical theatre classes.</p>
						<p>At Hills Ballet School we promote 'safe dance' ensuring that the content of our classes is age 
						appropriate. All teachers carry a current first aid certificate and 'Working with children' clearance.</p>
						<p>We would love to welcome you to our classes. Please contact us if you would like any further information.</p>

						<p>I have two favourite pastimes - dancing and teaching. At Hills Ballet School I have 
						found a place where I can combine both and I am always delighted to share my love of 
						dance with my students.</p>
						<p>Working as a dancer, dance teacher and classroom teacher for the last 25 years has 
						taken me on many adventures in Adelaide and worldwide.</p>
						<p>I am very thankful to all the little dancers who re-ignited my love of dance, 
						ballet and the joy of movement when I returned to Australia. 
						It is with great delight that I can see them now taking great leaps and bounds in 
						their movement education.</p>

						<p>When I was 7 years old I went to see a production of Annie at the Festival Theatre. 
						From that point on Musical Theatre has been in my life in one way or another, whether 
						it be as an avid listener and audience member, a performer or simply helping out backstage.</p>
						<p>I am very excited to have the opportunity to bring my love of this genre to The Hills Ballet 
						School and sharing it with the students. Singing is such a wonderful and joyous past time that I 
						am sure the students will enjoy combining their love of dance with song.</p>

						in Europe whilst working in Berlin, Portugal and London in the 90's, a Bachelor of Dance at VCA in 
						Melbourne graduating in 2004. Tanya is also a qualified yoga teacher and is passionate about 
						functional anatomy, which make for safe movement practice for students of all physical capabilities.</p>

						and throughout Tasmania. She has been resident of Adelaide since 2014, and enjoys living in the Hills
