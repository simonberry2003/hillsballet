        <div class="textbox"> 
            Hills Ballet school is a family owned ballet school located in the Adelaide Hills. We currently hold ballet classes at the Mount Lofty Scout Hut in Aldgate and the Aldgate Oval Hall. 
            <p>Our aim is to provide high quality, dynamic ballet and dance lessons that celebrate each dancer as an individual. 
            <p>The "Little Tiptoes" programme is specifically designed to meet the needs of younger dancers. Your little dancer can tiptoe with your support from the age of eighteen months.
            <p>When dancers are ready to dance independently they can join the "Leap into Dance" programme. In this fun, dynamic class, dancers are introduced to the basics of ballet technique, encouraging their creativity and love of movement.
            <p>Once dancers reach school age our lessons are based upon the Royal Academy of Dancing syllabus. At this level dancers can choose to participate in examinations. Above all we maintain our sense of fun and enjoyment that the challenges of dancing can bring.
            <p>Hills Ballet School classes are taught by Chantal Berry (RTS (Registered Teacher Status), BA (Performing Arts), PGCE (Post Grad Certificate of Education).

        <div class="textbox"> 
            I have danced and taught in Australia, UK and Europe working as an independent artist. I have extensive teaching experience in ballet and am a registered teacher for the Royal Academy of Dancing. 
            <p>Whilst taking a break from the world of dance I trained as a primary school teacher and now bring to my classes a love of dance and an in-depth knowledge of child development.
            <p>As well as twirling with my dancers at Hills Ballet School this year I will be ballet mistress at A Star dance and help some of Bebe Ballet’s dancers through their exams.
            <p>I  am very thankful to all the little dancers who have re-ignited my love of dance, ballet and the joy of movement over the last 2 years. I can’t wait to share this with my dancers and their families as we embark on an exciting journey into dance at Hills Ballet School.
