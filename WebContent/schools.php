<p>Hills Ballet School would love to dance with the children in your school!
<p>We offer high quality workshops and lessons supporting and facilitating the Performing Arts objectives of the Australian Curriculum.
<p>Through a range of dance genres we can explore any theme/idea you have within your school, with or without performance outcomes. We can create unique cross-curricular links to support the learning in your classrooms.
<p>Hills Ballet School can provide a Registered Teacher or a Highly Qualified Instructor dependent on your school's needs.
<p>HBS also acts as a consultant to schools which wish to develop their performing arts programmes or give teachers the opportunity for further training in the arts which will in turn help them to develop their own programmes of learning.
